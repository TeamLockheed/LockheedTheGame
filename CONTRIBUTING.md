- fuck you
- make branch for feature
- do not commit on master
- fork the project if you want to change it or make your own version
- open pull request if you want a code review or to merge a feature branch
- name branches `this-is-a-branch`
- create your files in the LockheedCore project and don't make separate projects
- start the game from Lockheed2D or LockheedConsole
- use folders and namespaces to separate classes in the LockheedCore
- forgot the rest cause I just lost them
